# Light_Seeking_555_bot
This is a design based on an instructible I found for a light following robot https://www.instructables.com/555-timer-based-light-seeking-robot/
I thought it would be cool to make it reversable and easy to assemble so if you flip the toggle switches on the board, instead of chasing light, it will run from the light.
all you need to build it is the Zip folder containing the circuit board, a robot chasssis with motors and some ics and smd components. All of that is available on Amazon
